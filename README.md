this is a 3d printable cardcage for the RetroBrew 3 slot ECB motherboard.

install openscad, run make, and print the generated STL files to your
heart's content.

the card cage fits together tightly, so you might want to make judicious
use of pliers to gently squeeze the dovetails together.

I printed mine on a flashforge guider 2S on PLA

i used 220 degrees filament, 60 degree platform with brim, no raft,
25% fill.

this hasn't been tuned.  the dovetails are tight, and a little filing
might also be desired.  that said, it's functional.

yeah, it's GPL3.  ship it and derived works with buildable source code; 
if you learned something from this, you must pay that learning forward.
